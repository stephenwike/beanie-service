Backlog

* Convert WebApi to redirect to https
* Add validation to angular forms - controller and create-game.
* Implement trigger end of game.  (End of game should not disable the controller from fixing errors in previous frames.)
* Remove "GetPlayers from service and API if not used".
* Remove WeatherForecastController (Replace with Ping controller?)
* Add pre-check to determine if game id already exists.
* Add a logger service

Improvements

* Investigate if there is a better way to handle connection (or pooling) within the API service.
* Metrics Scrapping?
* Health Check?
